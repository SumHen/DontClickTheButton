# 🚨 **Don't Click The Button!** 🚨
*A mischievous button that absolutely doesn't want to be clicked... or does it?*  

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://sumhen.github.io/DontClickTheButton/](https://sumhen.github.io/DontClickTheButton/)  

## 🤔 **What Even Is This?**  
My late-night coding experiment featuring:  
- A rebellious button that flees your cursor 🏃‍♂️  
- Sassy messages when you try too hard  
- Confetti explosions because why not? 🎉  
- "3 AM logic" at its finest  

## 🎮 **How to "Play"**  
1. Try to click the red button (good luck)  
2. After 15 escapes, you'll get... an *offer*  
3. Choose:  
   - **"No"**: Watch the text go crazy  
   - **"Yes"**: Spam it for secret messages
